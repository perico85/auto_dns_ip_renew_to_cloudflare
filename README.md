To execute the scripts, you must first edit the 'record_id.py' file with your data and run it; it will display the record IDs of the subdomain names that have been added.

Remember to remove the subdomain records that you do not want, meaning these scripts read 3 subdomains; more can be added if desired, respecting the structure of each one.
